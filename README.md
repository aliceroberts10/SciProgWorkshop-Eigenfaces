# SciProgWorkshop-Eigenfaces

This is a project that Alice Roberts and Kristen Bystrom completed for Math 496 - Special Topics in Mathematics of Data Science.

In this workshop participants will learn about human facial recognition and use MATLAB to explore which faces in a database are similar to theirs. We will introduce EigenFaces and the mathematics used to compute facial similarity including principal component analysis and singular value decomposition.
