# SciProgWorkshop-Eigenfaces
In this workshop participants will learn about human facial recognition and use MATLAB to explore which faces in a database are similar to theirs. We will introduce EigenFaces and the mathematics used to compute facial similarity including principal component analysis and singular value decomposition.
