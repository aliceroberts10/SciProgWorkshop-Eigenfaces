# SciProgWorkshop-Eigenfaces

This is a project that Alice Roberts and Kristen Bystrom completed for Math 496 - Special Topics in Mathematics of Data Science.

In this workshop participants will learn about human facial recognition and use MATLAB to explore which faces in a database are similar to theirs. We will introduce EigenFaces and the mathematics used to compute facial similarity including principal component analysis and singular value decomposition.

Step 1: 
Download all files on the Git Repository 

Step 2: 
Open https://matlab.mathworks.com/ 

Step 3: 
Create a new folder and add the files that were downloaded. 

Step 4: 
First run the file called "eigenfaces_svd.m" 

Step 5: 
Now, run file called "newFace.m"

Step 6: 
Now it's your turn. Take a photo of yourself, make sure that the photo is framing your face only and is centered.

Step 7:
Upload the image into the folder.
In file "newFace.m" in line 22, edit the code to include the name of the photo you just took. 
Run this file and view the image that the code provides. 
Behold, a photo from the database that is closest to yours!
